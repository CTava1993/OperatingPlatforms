# OperatingPlatforms

This portfolio project was more or less supposed to similate working on an actual software project professionally with another company. The idea is that I am to be outsourced to create a server application that would host a web-hosted game that could run on several operating platforms. This isn't something I would personally submit to an actual company to use, however the concept is more important than anything else here. The included Software Design Document will explain this in more detail and the entire program folder from Eclipse was added to the repository as well.


The following are my responses to a few prompts:
 
 
-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

I mentioned this above, but the idea was that the client (The Gaming Room) wanted to outsource me to create an application to run a web-hosted game that could run several instances of said game. It is called "Draw it or Lose it!", which generates 1 of 200 stock images over a time and 2 teams will guess at what the image is. The software is to be run on seveal operating platforms.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Neatness is typically my strong point in just about any project, especially with this field. I take a lot of pride in modularizing things to make them easy to read for the next person who should "take the torch", so to speak. Aside from this, I got really into making the initial fields of the document that describe the project and the requirements and such.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Just about all of the beginning segments I mentioned prior, honestly. It made it very easy to think of the ground work and imagine the infrastructure. There were clear parameters to avoid doing, while having goals to accomplish. This gave me the freedom to figure out the rest, more or less, which is what suits me best.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the evaluation piece. During the development of this design doc, I had to travel. This had me scrambling to find older versions of the design document, as they were on my desktop and not the laptop. I lacked the template, so the initial copy wasn't researched properly and was not a table. The end result was something serviceable, but extremely surface level in most cases.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I simply went from the ground up with the requirements in mind. Broad customer base, not too extravagant for cost, and it must be a mobile app for their website. This translates into a UI that connects several platforms to the client's website. Or better yet, to make things even simpler it could simply be a website accessed from the web browsers of all these platform, which requires only compatibility with as many browsers as possible. There are many ways to approach this.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Most of this project was the concept, rather than hard coding the actual software. So my approach was to take the concept seriously, which wound up being rather interesting instead of as silly as I anticipated. I took it like it was a professional work and went with it. Strategies I would use in the future would be to conduct more through research to ensure the actual software requirements for such a project, rather than an emulation of it.
